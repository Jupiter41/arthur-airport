# Example prompt to use after creating a new markdown with tasks

Before doing any edit, do this:

- READ all SPEC and skill files.
- READ scripts/ README.md if it exists.
- READ ROADMAP.md fully.
- READ all md files in docs/lessons-learned
- NEVER implement any roundabout fix. For any very complex thing, write a plan file in docs/lessons-learned/ and then implement it step by step.
- ALWAYS use fish ready command (so use bash -c when necessary) to run commands in the terminal, and make sure to use the right syntax for it.
- ALWAYS take the elegant solution, even if it takes more time. Don't do quick and dirty fixes.
- ALWAYS run tests and validate along the way the behaviour of the services by rebuilding the container, doing curls requests etc.
- ALWAYS keep interesting scripts you write for testing for example to evaluate flights, passengers etc. in this project folder in the `scripts/` folder with a helper_prefix, and document how to use them in a README in the folder.
- ALWAYS fix all bugs you see along the way, even if they are not in the original plan. If you see something that can be improved, do it.
- ALWAYS save into a tmp file the output of the logs or the curl requests to make your processing easier.
- ALWAYS clean any temporary file you created during the process.
- ALWAYS test services locally with docker-compose before pushing, and make sure to check the logs of the services to understand their behaviour.
- NEVER commit any temporary file.
- NEVER write code that you don't understand. If you don't understand something, ask for help or write a plan to investigate and understand it before writing the code.
- NEVER use sleep in terminal commands, precise to the user to wait before accepting the command.
- ALWAYS write a final summary of the changes you made, the issues you fixed, the tests you ran and the results you got in a md file in docs/lessons-learned/.
- ALWAYS mark issues as completed in the relevant file if needed.
- ALWAYS run the tests necessary to pass Github CI/CD at the end: ruff check, npm build etc.

The current task is "Add cost models and capacity planning scenarios". Your mission is to implement:
- Add a toggle in world map ui to allow to see grounded flights for simulated  flights and real ones.
- Make the world map ui nicer (not too many toggles etc.). Also allow user to select map style (dark, light, satellite) + select the range to display
-
