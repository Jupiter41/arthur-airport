# Example prompt to use after creating a new markdown with tasks

Before doing any edit, do this:

- READ all SPEC and skill files.
- READ scripts/ README.md if it exists.
- READ ROADMAP.md fully.
- READ all md files in docs/lessons-learned
- NEVER implement any roundabout fix. For any very complex thing, write a plan file in docs/lessons-learned/ and then implement it step by step.
- ALWAYS use fish ready command (so use bash -c when necessary) to run commands in the terminal, and make sure to use the right syntax for it.
- ALWAYS take the elegant solution, even if it takes more time. Don't do quick and dirty fixes.
- ALWAYS run tests and validate along the way the behaviour of the services by rebuilding the container, doing curls requests etc.
- ALWAYS keep interesting scripts you write for testing for example to evaluate flights, passengers etc. in this project folder in the `scripts/` folder with a helper_prefix, and document how to use them in a README in the folder.
- ALWAYS fix all bugs you see along the way, even if they are not in the original plan. If you see something that can be improved, do it.
- ALWAYS save into a tmp file the output of the logs or the curl requests to make your processing easier.
- ALWAYS clean any temporary file you created during the process.
- ALWAYS test services locally with docker-compose before pushing, and make sure to check the logs of the services to understand their behaviour.
- NEVER commit any temporary file.
- NEVER write code that you don't understand. If you don't understand something, ask for help or write a plan to investigate and understand it before writing the code.
- NEVER use sleep in terminal commands, precise to the user to wait before accepting the command.
- ALWAYS write a final summary of the changes you made, the issues you fixed, the tests you ran and the results you got in a md file in docs/lessons-learned/.
- ALWAYS mark issues as completed in the relevant file if needed.
- ALWAYS run the tests necessary to pass Github CI/CD at the end: ruff check, npm build etc.

Your mission is to:

- I think you could have one filter icon for each column and no need to add a new line in the tab when the user click on it, you can just open a popup
- Improve the documentation in particular for the configuration of the airport, precise each parameters, remove unnecessary ones, add interesting ones, and add examples of how to set them up for different scenarios (normal day, day with a special event, day with bad weather etc.). T
- Implement phase 5. For any LLM use etc., either use a good free option or write the logic yourself. If the user need to provide an API key, precise it in the instructions and ask them to put it in a .env file or something like that. You can ask it in chat if you need me to provide you with an API key for testing.
